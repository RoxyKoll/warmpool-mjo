# warm pool-mjo
Here we have provided the list of MJO events and the code for estimating the phase duration and warm pool area as in Roxy et al. 2019, Nature, "Twofold expansion of the Indo-Pacific warm pool warps the MJO lifecycle".

* "MJO_events" directory contains list of MJO events from 1981-2018 (Nov-Apr) with the data, MJO phase durations and Hovm√∂ller diagrams of filtered  NOAA OLR and CMAP precipitation. 
* "scripts" directory contains the python, ncl and shell scripts used for estimating different statistics of MJO lifecycle and warm pool.
